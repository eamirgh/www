As a self-made developer, It is hard to find new relevant technologies to learn, on the other hand you want to make progress and make variety to your skills and get prepared for better job opportunities. A solution is to find technologies which are used in the big companies, but how can you achieve this? It is not simple but you can find out from job opportunities of the company for example find a back-end hiring position and checkout the requirements and nice to have skills. Another trick is to find the people which are working for the company and follow them on twitter, in this case they will talk about their daily working stack/tools and they will retweet some interesting things to make your life easier to learn.
